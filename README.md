    Nmap NSE Script Tool (Bash)

1. Port Scanner without Nmap (Python)

File: simple_port_scanner.py
This tool uses Python's built-in socket module to scan the first 1024 ports on a given IP address.

python3 simple_port_scanner.py

Features:

    No third-party modules required

    Scans TCP ports from 1 to 1024

    Identifies open ports

2. Port Scanner using Nmap Module (Python)

File: nmap_port_scanner.py
This tool uses the python-nmap wrapper to scan open ports on a target IP.
Requirements:

Install the python-nmap module:

pip install python-nmap

Usage:

python3 nmap_port_scanner.py

Features:

    Scans ports 1-1024

    Displays service status of each open port

3. Overview of Nmap Python Module

python-nmap is a wrapper around the Nmap CLI tool, allowing integration of Nmap scans into Python scripts.
Key Methods:

    scan(hosts, ports) ‚Äî Runs the scan

    all_hosts() ‚Äî Lists all discovered hosts

    Access results like:
    scanner[host]['tcp'][port]['state']

    Useful for writing automation scripts in penetration testing.

4. Host Discovery Tool (Python)

File: host_discovery.py
This tool determines the default gateway IP address and its IP class (A, B, or C).
Usage:

python3 host_discovery.py

Features:

    Detects the default gateway (Linux only)

    Classifies IP address based on the first octet

5. Nmap NSE Script Tool (Bash)

File: nse_scan.sh
A Bash script that accepts a target IP and an NSE script name to run a custom Nmap scan.
Usage:

chmod +x nse_scan.sh
./nse_scan.sh <IP_ADDRESS> <NSE_SCRIPT_NAME>

Example:

./nse_scan.sh 192.168.1.1 http-enum

Features:

    Simplifies running advanced NSE-based scans

    Useful for penetration testing automation

üí° Notes

    All Python scripts are for educational use and run on Linux systems.

    Use sudo where required (e.g., for Nmap).

    Ensure Nmap is installed on your system:

    sudo apt install nmap
